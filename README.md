### This was my first personal project for COP 1500 - Intro to Computer Science. 

#### Inventory Control Program was written in Python.

#### The purpose of this program is for a retail cellphone store to keep track of their cellphone inventory on a daily basis. No classes or object-oriented programming methodologies were used in this program since I was only learning the basics of Python and programming in this course.
