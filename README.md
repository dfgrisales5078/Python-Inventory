### Inventory Control Program written in Python.

#### This was my first personal project for COP 1500 - Intro to Computer Science. 

#### The purpose of the program is for a retail cellphone store to keep track of their cellphone inventory on a daily basis. No functions or classes were used in this program since I was only learning the basics of Python and programming in this course.
