### This was my first personal project for COP 1500 - Intro to Computer Science. 

#### Inventory Control Program was written in Python.

#### The purpose of this program is for a retail cellphone store to keep track of their cellphone inventory on a daily basis. No classes or object-oriented programming methodologies were used in this program since I was only learning the basics of Python and programming in this course. 

#### Note: Please excuse the messy code. This was my first programming assignment and I had no prior knowledge of OOP or any other proper programming conventions. The purpose of this repo is to show my progress as a programmer since I started, and how I have evolved as I learn proper methodologies to apply to my code.
